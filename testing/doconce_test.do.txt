===== Computer code =====

Inline verbatim code, as in `import numpy as np`, is allowed, as well as
code blocks:

!bc pycod
from math import sin

def f(x):
    """Example on a function."""
    return sin(x) + 1

print f(0)
!ec

===== Mathematics =====

Formulas can be inline, as in $\nabla\cdot\bm{u} = 0$, or typeset
as equations:

!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla\cdot\bm{u} &= 0,\\
\bm{u} &= \nabla\phi .
\end{align*}
!et
